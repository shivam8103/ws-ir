    "Modulation is the process, in which one of the properties of the signal is changed according to baseband signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "And based on these 3 properties of signal (amplitude, phase, frequency), there are different types of modulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why modulation is required. \n",

    "## **1. To reduce the antenna size.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Antenna:\n",
    "- An antenna is a device that radiates or receives electromagnetic waves (radio signals).\n",
    "- It converts electrical signals from your transmitter into electromagnetic waves in the air, and vice versa for reception.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Antenna Size:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Antenna size** usually refers to the **physical length of the antenna**.\n",
    "* The **length is related to the wavelength ($\\lambda$)** of the signal it is designed to transmit or receive.\n",
    "* A common design rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Antenna length} \\approx \\frac{\\lambda}{2} \\text{ or } \\frac{\\lambda}{4}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why does wavelength matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Wavelength ($\\lambda$)** depends on frequency:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lambda = \\frac{c}{f}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c = 3\\times10^8$ m/s (speed of light) and $f$ = frequency in Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lower frequency → longer wavelength → longer antenna.\n",
    "* Higher frequency → shorter wavelength → shorter antenna.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Baseband digital signal: 1 kHz → wavelength = 300 km → impossible antenna (300/4 km)\n",
    "2. FM radio: 100 MHz → wavelength = 3 m → antenna \\~1.5 m (half-wave) → practical. (0.4 m)\n",
    "### **Key idea**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **antenna size** must “match” the wavelength to efficiently transmit or receive the signal.\n",
    "* If it’s too short or too long compared to the wavelength, **radiation efficiency drops**, and signal strength is weak.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. To reduce the interference.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Many devices transmit at the same time. Interference may happen.\n",
    "- Modulation allows different signals to occupy different frequency bands, avoiding interference.\n",
    "- Example: Radio stations use different carrier frequencies.\n",
