    "## 1. Client Server paradigm\n",

    "The fundamental purpose of a network is to allow user at one location to get service from a computer at remote locatation. This is called client-server paradigm. We can achieve this by running two types of programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A client requests a service (like a web browser requesting a webpage).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A server provides the service (like a web server sending that page back).\n",

    "## Principles of Client Server Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Separation of Roles:** Each program plays one role — either client or server, never both at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **One-to-Many:** One server can handle many clients (e.g., Google’s server handling millions of users).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Availability:** Clients start when a user wants something; servers stay active all the time waiting for requests.\n",

    "    - Send data (`send()` function)\n",
